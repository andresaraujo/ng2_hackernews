# A HackerNews application made with Angular2 Dart.

Pretty much inspired from the work by https://github.com/hswolff/hn-ng2 with a few changes and additions

The goal of this project is to show a sample application to get you started with Angular2 Dart.
It will be updated to work with the most recent Angular 2 version. 

## Usage

#### Install dependencies 
`pub get`
#### Run local web server
`pub serve`
#### open http://localhost:8080/

## [Live Demo](https://andresaraujo.github.io/)

## Issues

- Unable to make it work with Angular transformer so big js files for now ( ︶︿︶)

- Router migration is work in progress, seems to be partially broken as of alpha 28 ([#1950](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/1950))
