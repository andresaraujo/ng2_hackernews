# A HackerNews application made with Angular2 Dart.

Pretty much inspired from the work by https://github.com/hswolff/hn-ng2 with a few changes and additions

The goal of this project is to show a sample application to get you started with Angular2 Dart.
It will be updated to work with the most recent Angular 2 version. 

## Usage

#### Install dependencies 
`pub get`
#### Run local web server
`pub serve`
#### open http://localhost:8080/

## Issues
- Its seems that Dart2Js is failing with the current alpha. but you can test it on 
[Dartium](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/)

- Router migration is work in progress, seems to be partially broken as of alpha 26 ([#1950](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/1950))
